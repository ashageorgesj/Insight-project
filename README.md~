# Project Idea
Clickstream analysis for building better websites designed for revenue generation

# Purpose and Use cases
1) Conversion trends - from online marketplaces(clickthrough, basket placement and purchase). Clicking on a product information page means the product has generated interest. If there is not much conversion from click to basket rate, it may be due to poor price point or display
2) Click-path Optimization and effectiveness of ad campaigns- Collect and analyze data to see pages visitors are visiting and in what order.
3) Market basket analysis- what products people buy together, making recommendations and making another sale.
4) Conversion rate from watching third-party content to original content(Netflix lures customers into watching its original content by advertising the more popular third party content).
5) How competitors are making conversions
6) Any online behaviors- favorite cars, searches etc.
